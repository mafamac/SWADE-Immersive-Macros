## [0.18.0] - 2022-05-09
### Added
- Mighty Summoner: Summoned Creatures now get an Active Effect with the appropriate duration. Duration is doubled if the summoner has the Concentration Edge.
- Various new assets (see ReadMe for credits, all altered by SalieriC#8263):  
- New translation strings.
- New Setting rule: No Power Points. This enables near-infinite duration and a -1 to the spellcasting roll on the caster. SWIM does not use the systems setting rule in case that gets changed to do other things as well.
- New Macro: Power Effect Builder. Opens a dialogue to add active effects for almost all maintained core powers. This makes heavy use of the new effect updater by SUCC. **Make sure to update SUCC, unless you want total carnage.**

</details>  

- - Enabled near-infinite duration on powers if no power points setting rule active.
- - Add an AE to the caster if he is not the target, that gives the casters spellcasting trait a -1 for maintaining the power if the power is found and no power points is active. In case no power points is not used, an AE is added to the caster (if the power is found) thats sole purpose is to track and cancel maintained powers.
- - If there is no active combat, start round of the effects will be set to 0 which ensures that the duration will work if combat starts while the AE is applied.
- If a power effect is set up using the power effect builder, the caster gains the ability to delete the AE on all actors he previously added it to. That means if the caster drops the power (or the duration runs out) it will be dropped on each actor, giving full control over maintenance to the player.
- Localisation for:
- - Fear Table function.
- - Mark Dead function.
- Various new localisation strings.
- New setting to check single reload by default.
- Make tokens invisible (no player owner) or half transparent (player owner) when the invisibility condition is applied.
- Make tokens slightly less visible if an effect called "Intangibility" (or their localised counterpart) is applied.
- Token Vision macro opens up if the torch condition is applied or removed.
- The Holding condition makes the token indeed holding in the combat tracker. Removing the condition prompts the player with a dialogue to choose between acting now or after current turn. The initiative is then set appropriately. This gives the player more control over their own initiative and alleviates GM workload.
- On world load SWIM will set the round time to 6 seconds as appropriate to the setting. This is a temporary implementation and will be removed as soon as the system covers this by itself.
- Added plea for support on SWIM config menu.
### Changed
- Incapacitation and Bleeding Out are added as overlays instead of small icons now. Inc. will be set as small icon if Bleeding Out is applied.
- Changed and fixed Deviation link to be future proof.
### Fixed
- Various errors in the personal health center that prevented chat messages from being created.
- Incorrectly named translation string.
- Fixed a bug in the ammo management where single reloading a weapon which is full would overflow the weapons capacity.
- Fixed a bug that caused weapons which do not require reloading actions to reload anyway.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the removal of Shaken if all Wounds were soaked.  

## [0.17.1] - 2022-04-27
### Fixed
- Faulty Translation string in Ammo Management (@Razortide)  

## [0.17.0] - 2022-04-21
### Added
- Combat Setup Button in the Token Actions:
- - Automatically adds all tokens on the current scene to the combat tracker (excluding NPCs which are incapacitated)
- - Automatically starts combat, drawing initiative for all tokens and sets the turn to the first token
- Settings to define a combat playlist which starts when combat starts
- When combat starts, all playlists are stopped
- - There is a way to define a folder in the settings which holds playlists that are never stopped on combat start.
- Added Macro Option tab in SWIM configuration window.
- Added ability for Shape Change function to have the token be a larger size on a raise. The scale multiplier is a configurable option in the Macro Option tab (@pmoore603).
- Added constants.js file as a central repository for constant values (@pmoore603).
- Dismiss function for the Mighty Summoner: If the selected token is a summoned creature, the owner (and GMs) can choose to dismiss it instead of summoning a new creature.
- Token Vision now supports custom (and preset) light colours.
- Started localization of some macros (@Razortide). This is far from being finished and a long-term project but there will be some amount of process in future releases until it's all done.  
- New sound effect for use in the token vision.
### Changed
- Enhanced Shape Change function to morph changing token into each other by growing/shrinking size and opacity (alpha) of both tokens as needed (@pmoore603).
- - This can be configured (and disabled) in the settings.
- Enhanced numeric input handling for SWIM configuration. Allows number input fields to have min, max, and step fields, which allows fields to be range and precision (decimal places) checked (@pmoore603).
- Token Vision now enables non-GMs to edit their vision type.
### Fixed
- Corrected an issue in the Shape Change function where temporary preset actors were incorrectly cleaned up. The issue happened when the player transforms into the same creature twice (or more) in a row (@pmoore603).

## [0.16.0] - 2022-04-03
### Added
- Common Bond function to give a Benny from one token to another.
- Free Reroll to the Radiation Centre macro if the Soldier Edge is found.
- Added warnings to some functions to install Helath Estimate if it is not installed.
- Localisation for Edges and Abilities. The module should now be *functional* in other languages. Please note that a lot of texts are still not localised. This is a lengthy process that will be done bit by bit over the course of the following months. New functionality will be fully localised however.
- Added Coup (50 Fathoms) to the benny checker.
- Added SFX to execute when BR2 sends the unshake hook.
- Added SFX player to the API.
- Added default volume option to the settings.
- Mighty Summoner macro that summons a creature selected by the user.  
- Soak Damage now allows for Incapacitation rolls and applies appropriate injuries.
- PHC can heal Wounds and remove fatigue for non-owned tokens/actors in the Personal Health Centre (PHC).
- PHC offers a way to use the Healing *skill* in combat to remove Bleeding Out and/or Inc but not Wounds (important because healing Wounds takes ten minutes, stabilising however is an Action).
- PHC now removes combat injuries and those from Incapacitation (unless they are permanent).
- PHC now removes Bleeding Out before and Incapacitation with Wounds.
- PHC now removes the Health Estimate flag if Incapacitated.
- Shape Changer now copies the permission settings from the original actor to give the player owner permissions.
- Shape Changer adds focus to new token.
### Changed
- Refactored the shape changer script to a few less lines (@pmoore603).
- Shape changer now makes the newly created actor the same `type` as the original. This means that PCs will change into PCs and NPCs will change into NPCs, no matter what the preset type is. This is important for the Joker's Wild setting rule to work properly.
- GMs are now able to access all shape change sizes instead of only those the characters rank permits.
- The injury table results are no longer checked with case sensitive translation strings.
### Fixed
- Radiation Centre will now inform about Benny use.
- Small fix in shape changer that will hopefully update the combat.
- Combat injuries were not properly applied in soak damage.
- A bug that caused the PHC to break because of a faulty setting string.
- A leftover variable declaration in the shape changer caused it to fail when trying to play the VFX if executed by a non-GM.
- Fixed missing variable exception error when shape changing (@pmoore603).
- Shape changer now adds elevation of the original token to the newly created token (thanks @pmoore603 for spotting this).
- Shape changer now creates the new actor in the proper folder even if executed by non-GM.
- Shape changer dialogue now gets the proper div class.
- Unstun doesn't remove prone but now properly removes stunned on a raise (thanks @Razortide for spotting).
- Macros now have the proper icons from SUCC.
### Languages:
- English
- German (@Razortide)

## [0.15.0] - 2022-03-18
### Added  
- A full-fledged, all-new API the module makes much use of now. Thanks to honeybadger#2614 for the suport on setting it up.  
- Finally an auto-updateable BR2 Ammo Management macro. You'll need to import it from the BR2 folder inside the SWIM compendium into your world (or just copy and paste the one line of code to the macro you already have) and you're set, no need to manually update it ever again (hopefully).  
- A documentation for the new API.
- A new configuration menu with tabs (made by @javierriveracastro).  
- Default options for the chase setup.
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Due to changes in Foundry VTT core all script macros had to be pulled out of the compendium and are now maintained as .js files in the module itself. As a Result, *all auto-update macros became unusable*. You need to import the new auto-update macros in your world (and delete the old ones), then you'll be set up for the future. This time for good (hopefully).  
- More options on laying out cards for other chase scenes (made by @pmoore603).  
- Shape Changer now adds the new token (the target of the shape shift) up in the combat tracker.  
### Fixed
- Players were unable to execute the macros due to permission enforcement changes in FVTT core. This is fixed via the aboce change.  
- Players are now able to use the Shape Changer macro. Before it was GM only because of permission issues. Now it relays the script to the GM.  
### Removed
- Deprecated all the standard macros. They are still available for reference on the repo but won't be maintained anymore. The core features are integrated into the module now and others may follow.  

## [0.14.1] - 2022-03-06  
### Added
- Stealth added as a Skill for Consumable Weapons in the BR2 Ammo Management macro.  
### Fixed  
- Fixed a bug in the (Un-)Shake and Soak Damage macros where they were still using the old way of toggling the status which caused the status to not be toggled properly.
- Fixed a bug in the BR2 ammo usage macro that caused it to not get the ammo without te loaded ammo additional stat.
- Fixed a bug that made the Unshake macro non-functional.
- Fixed a bug that prevented installing the module.  

## [0.14.0] - 2022-02-15  
### Added  
- [SUCC](https://github.com/SalieriC/SUCC) dependency. SWADE v.1+ handles conditions inherently different from the way they were handled before, thus making CUB not viable any longer. Since CUB will likely take a long time until it is compatible with SWADE once again, I have teamed up with Javier again to create SUCC which works similar to CUBs Enhanced Conditions but it built for SWADE and thus requires less setup.
- A new setting to register the Irradiated Condition.
- Hijacked (or rather: replaced) the SWADE systems "Clear Chase" button and added the Chase Layout Manager instead. Make sure to only use it on one of the chase layout scenes. Nothing bad will happen otherwise but the macro may not place the cards as expected.
- Added a compendium with a chase deck roll table and a compendium with the cards for that table since SWADE is going to remove the compendium with the images.
### Removed
- CUB dependency. Please disable CUB in your world and use [SUCC](https://github.com/SalieriC/SUCC) instead to continue using SWIM.
- All the condition icons as they are now in SUCC.
- CUB imports as they are of no use now.
- CUB setup documentation as it is not needed anymore.
- Removed SWADE Systems chase button from the left scene controls.
### Fixed  
- A bug in the shape changer macro that could cause issues when updating skills.  
- A bug in the shape changer macro that caused players not showing all their options to shift into in creature form.
- Fixed a bug in the Deviation Macro, that made it non-functional.
### Changed  
- Changed the way token size settings are applied in the shape changer macro to reduce load and thus improve performance.  
- Changed the macros to use [SUCC](https://github.com/SalieriC/SUCC) rather than CUB for handling conditions.
- Changed the check for the Irradiated condition in the radiation centre macro from CUB to SUCC and added a dialogue for GMs to activate it from the macro itself.
- Changed the license of the chase layouts. They may *not* be redistributed under any circumstances.

## [0.13.0] - 2022-01-21  
### Added
- Function to test for crit fails in the swim class, to make it centrally available for all macros.  
- Shape Changer Macro which does everything for you, you just need to set up some presets the players can shape shift into.  
### Fixed  
- Fixes a bug with duplicate chat messages in the (Un-)Shake Macros.  
- Fixed showing an npc as crit failing when it rolled a single 1. 
### Changed  
- Set all compendiums from SWIM to be hidden from players by default.  
### Known Issues  
- Shape Changer Macro does not update permissions on the duplicate actor. This currently cannot be changed due to limitations in Foundry core.  
- Shape Changer Macro does not delete powers on the presets yet.  

## [0.12.3] - 2022-01-16  
### Fixed  
- Fixes a bug with faulty libWrapper dependency.
  
## [0.12.2] - 2022-01-15  
### Added
- Added "Amorphous" (The After) to the (Un-)Shake macros.
### Fixed
- Added the dependencies to the manifest and added a warning to the init hook if they are not present.
- Also added libWrapper, not required by SWIM itself but by compendium-folders so I stuck it in there because FVTT doesn't check dependencies of dependencies.

## [0.12.1] - 2021-12-27  
### You need to update these macros:  
- None, unless you're still using the script macros ([see releases notes to 0.10.1](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/releases/tag/v.0.10.1)).  
- - Seriously, if you've not done so yet, do so now. This is the last major release this message will be shown.  
### Added  
- Gritty Damage (Soak Damage macro) now applies the appropriate Active Effects. Since I am not including a table for this and had issues with the sub-tables, it searches the table results text for words it can allocate to an AE. Thus it is important to use either the original table or include those words in your own table (case insensitive): "unmentionables", "arm", "leg", "guts", "broken", "battered", "busted", "head", "hideous scar", "blinded" and "brain". Do *not* use any of these words in other table results.  
### Changed  
- Soak Damage macro now doesn't exclude the GM from applying Gritty Damage any longer. Instead it only applies them to PCs by default. You can activate Gritty Damage for NPCs in the modules settings though.  

## [0.12.0] - 2021-12-17  
### You need to update these macros:  
- BR2 Ammo Usage  
- None other, unless you're still using the script macros ([see releases notes to 0.10.1](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/releases/tag/v.0.10.1)).  
- - Seriously, if you've not done so yet, do so now. This is the last major release this message will be shown.  
### Added  
- New game setting, allowing GMs to rule that NPCs do not use Ammo items from inventory. NPCs will still use Ammo in the weapon (magazines, clips, etc.) but won't require an item to draw ammo from. Instead they will just reload the weapon to the maximum shots (or by 1 shot if "Single Reload" is checked) without using an item from the inventory. This is especially useful for official modules which do not populate actors with ammunition, making prep for SWIM compatibility a little easier.  
- CUBs latest methods to apply status effects to the (Un-)Stun macro, making it a lot more stable and fixing a bug at the same time.  
- Radiation Centre macro. This macro rolls Vigor and applies Fatigue based on the result from radiation and is also able to apply Fatigue from radiation directly. It makes use of a new status called "Irradiated". An optional additional stat "Radiation Resistance" with the key "radRes" can be added to actors to provide a direct modifier to the roll, useful for settings which make heavy use of Radiation. The additional stat does not need to be set up in order for the macro to function.  
- "Irradiated" status added to the CUB mapping file in the module.  
### Fixed  
- Deprecation warnings, should be compatible with Foundry VTT v9 now. Let me know if I missed something.  
- (Un-)Stun macro adding a new prone status.  
### Removed  
- Prone image game setting, as it is no longer needed with the changes in CUB. The (Un-)Stun macro will now apply the prone status directly, instead of the icon. The macro will also check if the status is set up and throw a warning if not.  
- Removed Sprawlrunners CSS usage on the Falling Damage macro as it doesn't work well in the chat message.  
### Known issues  
- There are a couple of deprecation warnings caused when executing some macros which actually come from CUB. This is due to the fact that CUB has not been updated to v9 yet and will likely cause issues on v9 because of that. This is nothing I can change right now. Wait until CUB has been updated before updating to FVTT v9.  

## [0.11.0] - 2021-12-05  
### You need to update these macros:  
- None, unless you're still using the script macros ([see releases notes to 0.10.1](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/releases/tag/v.0.10.1)).  
### Added  
- **Falling Damage Macro.** It supports all options from the core rules and rolls for each selected and targeted token individually. Dialogue CSS credit: Kyane von Schnitzel#8654. The macros chat message uses the CSS of the activated core module (if any), supported are SWADE, Deadlands, Sprawlrunners and Pathfinder. It works without these modules as well though.  
**Bounty Notice:** I have very limited time atm. Everyone who creates merge requests with (working) updates to the macros which respect changes from Foundry version 9 (and thus gets rid of the warnings in the console) will receive a reward in the form of a free, high quality Battle Map. You may choose from one of these settings: Medieval Fantasy, Western or Pirates. A merge request covering three or more macros (that have not yet been covered) will be rewarded with an export of the selected map, set up with walls, lights and everything. The first merge request that covers *all* macros and works will be rewarded with a custom made battle map made after *your* specifications (within a reasonable degree of detail).  

## [0.10.3] - 2021-11-16  
### You need to update these macros:  
- None, unless you're still using the script macros ([see releases notes to 0.10.1](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/releases/tag/v.0.10.1)).  
### Fixed  
- The chat message of Soak Wounds now shows the systems benny image.  
### Added  
- The two Unshake macros now utilise the actors `data.attributes.spirit.unShakeBonus` data. As of yet, the system does not support this but the bonus is added in case a script changed it on an actor. It also checks all Active Effects on the actor for this and applies the modifier individually if the AE is active, making it finally possible to affect the Unschake macro with AEs (and thus items that use AEs to affect unshake).  
**Warning:** Do *not* use an AE to set the `data.attributes.spirit.unShakeBonus` for Edges that are already covered by the Unshake macors, otherwise the bonus will be added twice.  

## [0.10.2] - 2021-11-15  
### You need to update these macros:  
- None, unless you're still using the script macros (see previous releases notes).  
### Fixed  
- Fixed a bug in data structure resulting in not getting owned potions in the Personal Health Centre macro.  
- Fixed a minor bug that resulted in not waiting for the drinking sound before the next sfx.  
### Changed (**Breaking**)  
- Changed the setup for Potion names from comma-space seperated (', ') to pipe seperated ('|'). You need to adjust the settings manually if you're already using SWIM, otherwise the macro will not find the potions. This was done to make comma useable in potion names for better sorting (i.e. `Healing Potion, lesser`). So a string like "Healing Potion, Greater Healing Potion" now needs to be changed to "Healing Potion|Greater Healing Potion".  

## [0.10.1] - 2021-11-11  
### You need to update these macros:  
- **All of them.** (Now featuring: Automatic updates, see below.)  
### Fixed  
- Mark dead now gets the correct SFX from the actor.  
- Mark dead and Soak Damage updated to obey the current flag use for marking a token as dead of Health Estimate.  
### Added  
- Automatic updates for macros by using dummy macros that just call the original. From now on, use all the macors in the compendiums "User Macros (use these)" folder. The other folder contains the script macros which you don't need anymore.  
- - If you're using the BR2 Macros for handling ammo and power sfx you need to copy those into your world as usual. I'm, working on a solution for this as well but haven't found one yet.  

## [0.10.0] - 2021-10-31  
**Note:** From my testing this is compatible with Foundry 0.8.x but - as usual with software development - problems may occur. Please report them on this repo as usual.  
**Bounty Notice:** I have very limited time atm. Everyone who creates merge requests with (working) updates to the macros which respect changes from Foundry version 9 (and thus gets rid of the warnings in the console) will receive a reward in the form of a free, high quality Battle Map. You may choose from one of these settings: Medieval Fantasy, Western or Pirates. A merge request covering three or more macros (that have not yet been covered) will be rewarded with an export of the selected map, set up with walls, lights and everything. The first merge request that covers *all* macros and works will be rewarded with a custom made battle map made after *your* specifications (within a reasonable degree of detail).  
### You need to update these macros:  
- SWIM: Ammo Management  
- (Un-)Shake (both)  
- (Un-)Stun  
- Ammo Management (enhanced)  
- Mark Dead  
- Soak Damage  
- Spend Benny
- Chase Setup  
### New Macros:  
- Loot-o-Mat (see ReadMe)  
### Added
- Support for the *weaken undead* power (Hellfrost) in the Unshake (SWD) macro that disables the +2 bonus if the token is undead but has an active effect called "Undead" that is disabled.  
- Support for actor specific shaken and unshake sfx.  
- The macros now use the Benny image configured in the system.  
- Ammo Management now supports attack sounds for regular, frenzy and improved frenzy attacks, this requires the Ammo field to contain "MELEE".  
### Fixed  
- Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented a second shot sfx to be played in the BR2 integration.  

## [0.9.0] - 2021-07-05  
**Possibly** compatible with Foundry 0.8.x but I can't say for sure.  
### You need to update these macros:  
- Ammo Management (enhanced)  
- SWIM: Ammo Management  
### Added  
- Now also features the ability to play SFX only without the need for ammunition. For this just set the Ammo on the weapon to be `NONE` (exactly like this). This may be useful if you want SFX for melee weapons. It uses the same sfx path structure (see below), so you'll have the same sfx for melee and ranged attacks unfortunately.   
- Chase Setup macro for a quick setup that takes only a click. Also supports cleaning the table.  
- Six chase layouts, one for foot/riding chases, one for (ground) vehicle chases and one for ship (watercraft, aircraft and spacecraft) chases/battles with regular and modern theme each. See the [Chase Scenes documentation](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/blob/main/documentation/Chase%20Scenes.md) for details.  
- Immersion macro to play SFX when using powers in BR2. It does not manage Power Points, just plays a sound effect when using a power.  
### Fixed  
- Fixed the BR2 integration .json files. Now it isn't neccessary any longer to set up a World Global Action for each skill, the integration will trigger whenever a weapon or power is rolled on, no matter the skill, even untrained.  

## [0.8.0] - 2021-07-01
**Possibly** compatible with Foundry 0.8.x but I can't say for sure.  
### You need to update these macros:  
- (Un-)Stun  
- Ammo Management (enhanced)  
- SWIM: Ammo Management  
### Added  
- Ammo Management: Now supports Weapons that do not require a reload action (i.e. bows).  
- Ammo Management: Now offers a way to only reload a single bullet instead of reloading the entire weapon. This is especially useful for revolvers and such.  
- Ammo Management: Charge Packs can now change the ammo type but old Charge Packs are only refilled if the weapons current shots are equal the maximum shots as there is no way to track remaining charges on a Charge Pack.  
- Ammo Management (BR2 integration only): Now supports weapons which *may* be thrown but don't need to. It filters for a set of Skills and only applies ammo usage if such skills are found. See the [documentation on Ammo Management](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/blob/main/documentation/Ammo%20Management%20Setup.md) for further details.  
- BR2 integration for ammo management now gets the correct amount of shots from BR2 (requires [Better Rolls 2 (BR2)](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/betterrolls-swade2) **greater** than version 2.36.).  

## [0.7.0] - 2021-05-29  
### You need to update these macros:  
- All of them.  
### Fixed  
- All Macros that became broken due to the Foundry Version 0.7.10
- Fixed a bug in the Unshake (SWADE) macro that removed Shaken on a Failure.  
### Added  
- Reload and Reload (enhanced) macro.  
- BR2 integration for Shooting action.  
- Scale calculator macro, thanks @brunocalado.  
- Deviation macro, thanks @brunocalado.  
- (Un-)Stun now also applies Elan bonus on rerolls if the selected token has that edge.  
## VERY IMPORTANT:  
Most of these macros cannot be used as they are, reading the [ReadMe](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/blob/main/README.md) is **mandatory**!  
If you want to use the new Ammo Managemenet, make sure to read the [Documentation on Ammo Management](https://github.com/SalieriC/SWADE-Immersive-Macros/blob/main/documentation/Ammo%20Management%20Setup.md) as well!  
I can't stress enough how important it is to do so. *Do not blame me, if something goes sideways if you haven't read and followed the steps outlined there!*
